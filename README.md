# NVIDIA Integration for AutoSpa AI-Enhanced Car Self-Cleaning System

## Project Overview
The AutoSpa AI-Enhanced Car Self-Cleaning System leverages advanced AI-powered automation and computer vision to optimize and streamline the car cleaning process. By integrating the **NVIDIA DeepStream SDK**, we enable real-time AI-based video analytics and edge processing, ensuring efficient detection, assessment, and cleaning optimization.

To maximize performance, scalability, and AI inference efficiency, we require a dedicated **NVIDIA GPU environment**. As part of this initiative, we seek NVIDIA GPU credits and integration into the **NVIDIA Inception Program** to further enhance our system’s AI-driven automation capabilities.

## NVIDIA SDK and Hardware Utilization

### **NVIDIA DeepStream SDK**
- Enables real-time AI-powered video analytics
- Optimized for AI inference and edge computing
- Supports multiple video streams with minimal latency

### **NVIDIA GPUs Used**
- **Target GPU:** NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPU
- **Purpose:** Accelerates AI inference, computer vision, and automation
- **Scalability:** Ensures faster processing times, improved detection accuracy, and low-latency execution

## AWS GPU Instances for AI Inference
To support real-time AI inference and seamless automation, we require high-performance AWS EC2 GPU instances:

### **Primary Instance: g5.2xlarge**
- **NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPU**
- **8 vCPUs, 32 GiB RAM**
- Optimized for AI inference, video analytics, and automation
- Provides cost-efficient yet powerful AI processing

### **Additional Instance Options:**
- **g5 Family Instances** – Scalable, efficient, and optimized for DeepStream-based AI models
- **p4 Family Instances (Future Scaling)** – Equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, ideal for deep learning training and large-scale AI automation

## Justification for NVIDIA and AWS Credits
To deliver a **seamless AI-powered self-cleaning experience**, we require:
- **NVIDIA A10G GPU access** for optimized AI inference and processing
- **AWS GPU credits** for deploying DeepStream-based AI models on high-performance EC2 instances
- **NVIDIA Inception Program** membership for access to exclusive AI resources and support

Securing these resources will enable us to:
- Enhance system efficiency and reduce latency
- Improve AI model accuracy and performance
- Scale AI-driven automation for a wider user base

## Getting Started
### **Prerequisites**
